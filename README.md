Checks if your Java program has #swag. With my own Java parser.

## Status
Currently it's all proof of concept. The parser is far from complete,
the style checker just prints dummy messages. The Tokenizer should now be
language specification compliant (except for one minor thing).

If you want to collaborate, please contact me or create an issue/pull request.


## Why?
It probably looks crazy to parse java source on my own. I agree. It would be a
total waste of time, if I just wanted to make a Java style checker. But I want
to learn about parsing a language, so I will use an self written parser instead
of a library.
