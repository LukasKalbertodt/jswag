Java Style Checker
==================

Checks if your Java program has #swag. With my own Java parser.

## Status
Currently it's all proof of concept. The lexer and parser are far from complete,
the style checker just prints dummy messages. I implemented the current version
in about a week and will stop working on it for some time now (due to
university work).

If you want to collaborate, please contact me or create an issue/pull request.


## Why?
It probably looks crazy to parse java source on my own. I agree. It would be a
total waste of time, if I just wanted to make a Java style checker. But I want
to learn about parsing a language, so I will use an self written parser for
that instead of a library.
